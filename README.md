Polymer is a JavaScript library created by Google, that helps you build custom reusable HTML elements, and use them to build performant, maintainable apps. In this website, I experimented using core-tooltip polymer component, to display tooltips for the bottom navigation images. In order to run polymer component functionality, please make sure to run the rendered html version under: https://kamalfarhat.github.io/my-portfolio/

The portfolio website has a responsive design with 3 breakpoints @ 350px, 700px and 1000px. srcset was used in the img elements to provide optimized images to users on all device sizes
